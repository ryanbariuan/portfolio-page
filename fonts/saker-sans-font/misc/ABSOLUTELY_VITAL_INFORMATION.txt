Saker Sans is a light-hearted sans-serif typeface. 
Designed by Måns Grebäck during 2016 and 2017, its comical expression works great in happy contexts.  

It comes as a family of five weights: 
Saker Sans Thin, Saker Sans Light, Saker Sans Medium, Saker Sans Bold and Saker Sans Black. 

Due to the large number of glyphs, the font supports a wide range of languages.
